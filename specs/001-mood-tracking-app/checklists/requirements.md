# Specification Quality Checklist: Mood Tracking Application

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All validation items passed successfully. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Summary

**Passed**: 16/16 checklist items

**Key strengths**:
- User stories are prioritized (P1-P4) and independently testable
- Each story includes clear "Why this priority" and "Independent Test" sections
- Acceptance scenarios follow Given-When-Then format consistently
- Edge cases are comprehensive and address real-world scenarios
- Functional requirements are specific, measurable, and avoid implementation details
- Success criteria are measurable, technology-agnostic, and user-focused
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are clear
- Key entities defined without implementation specifics

**No issues found** - specification meets all quality standards.
